# ABSTRACT

The detection of methane on Mars, ranging from a few ppbv to ∼100 ppbv, and contrary reports of non-detection have intrigued the community for more than two decades. Reports of detection with Earth-based observations, from Martian orbit, and on the surface have been challenged on theoretical grounds, on the quality of the signal, and on the interpretation of results.  

The highly sensitive **ExoMars TGO’s ACS and NOMAD instruments** put an upper limit of a few pptv, several orders of magnitude below what was reported earlier. However, the ExoMars observations are made at fixed local times and are not sensitive to the atmosphere near the surface.  

The **Emirates Mars Mission (EMM)** provides near-global coverage of the planet every 9 sols. We use data from the **EMIRS infrared spectrometer** on board EMM during Mars Year 36 and archival data of **MGS/TES** to search for absorption at the C-H bending mode of methane at 1306 cm⁻¹.  

We report:
- An upper limit of **4 ppbv (day)** and **10 ppbv (night)** for methane detection using EMM/EMIRS.  
- An upper limit of **2 ppbv** for methane detection using MGS/TES.  

These results are consistent with the latest **MSL** and **TGO** findings. Future observations with EMM will further refine these constraints.
